            In California, the power grid produced for the state 203 million megawatt hours in 2022.
            This was the fourth highest amount of energy produced in the United States.
            A single megawatt hour represents nearly 2 average California houses monthly electricity usage<sup>[#]</sup>.
            The sources for this energy are distributed between renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear power.
            The 203 million MWhs is what is available on the power grid over the year, realistically
            the power that was used to make that energy is significantly higher than how much can be used.
