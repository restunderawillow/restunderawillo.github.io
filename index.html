    <hr>
    <div align="justify">
        <p>
            In California, the power grid produced <b>203 million</b> megawatt hours in 2022<sup>[11]</sup>.
            This was the fourth highest amount of energy produced in the United States.
            A single megawatt hour represents nearly the monthly electricity usage of <b>2</b> average California houses<sup>[12]</sup>.
            The sources for this energy are distributed among renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear power.
            The 203 million MWh is what is available on the power grid over the year, however,
            the power that was used to generate that energy is significantly higher than how much can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the non-renewable energy sources are inefficient with the energy used to operate power plants.
            The most productive energy source currently is natural gas, also being the most efficient, but for the <b>96 million MWh</b> that it produced in 2022,
            the power plants released the equivalent of <b style="color: red;">54 million MWh</b> as heat and waste<sup>[11]</sup>.
            For the <b>114 million MWh</b> produced through fossil fuels and nuclear energy, there is a total waste energy of <b style="color: red">159 million MWh</b><sup>[11]</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the images below, I have marked the lost electricity as it goes through the power grid.
            The first white image represents the total amount of energy resources put into the power plants.
            As electricity leaves the power plants, all of the <b style="color: blue;"><i>BLUE</i></b>-colored area is lost to heat and waste.
            Already, <b style="color: red;">58%</b> of the energy is gone<sup>[11]</sup>.
            The <b style="color: teal;"><i>TEAL</i></b> color represents the <b style="color: red;">5%</b> of electricity lost in power lines
            and power stations between the plants and the final user<sup>[14]</sup>.
            The <b style="color: rgb(0,255,0);"><i>GREEN</i></b> color shows the amount of the energy that is lost in 
            battery storage, which loses <b style="color: red;">10%</b> of the electricity that is stored<sup>[9]</sup>. 
            Currently, this is on the lower end, but battery storage is one of the most important parts of the 
            renewable-based power grid, so it will grow with time.
        </p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/totredoclose.jpg" alt="Energy Loss as Heat" class="contain">
        <div align="justify">
            <p>
                This leaves the white area remaining at the end of the graph, accounting for <b>40%</b> of the
                input energy for non-renewable sources and representing <b>43%</b> of the total energy usage of California in 2022<sup>[11]</sup>.
                Below is the complete graphic of the fossil fuels and nuclear energy losses, with the amount of energy
                used by all California households in one month colored <b style="color: red;"><i>RED</i></b><sup>[12]</sup>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/CAUSEredo.jpeg" alt="Million Homes" class="contain">
        <div align="justify">
            <p>
                Comparatively, the following is the graphic for the renewable energy sources.
                In these sources, the conversion from energy to electricity yields <b style="color: red;">no heat or waste</b><sup>[15]</sup>.
                Thus, the energy loss is solely due to transmission and battery storage.
                I have included the red box to represent the average monthly electricity usage of all Californian households to give a scale for the energy loss.
                The size of the red box is larger than in the non-renewable images because, in 2022, the majority of the energy produced in 
                California was generated by non-renewable power plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, California is following an energy scoping plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045<sup>[10]</sup>.
                Support is necessary to help maintain investment in the transition to renewable energy.
                Additionally, new renewable sources like offshore wind are being introduced along portions
                of the California coast, creating more sources to support the power grid. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To view California's progress in the scoping plan, visit the California
                <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/climate-dashboard/">Climate Dashboard.</a>
                On the website, you can see their suggestions for how to contribute
                to the goal of carbon neutrality.
