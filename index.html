        <p>
            In California, the power grid produced for the state <b>203 million</b> megawatt hours in 2022.
            This was the fourth highest amount of energy produced in the United States.
            A single megawatt hour represents nearly <b>2</b> average California houses monthly electricity usage<sup>[#]</sup>.
            The sources for this energy are distributed between renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear power.
            The 203 million MWhs is what is available on the power grid over the year, however,
            the power that was used to make that energy is significantly higher than how much can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the non renewable energy sources are inefficient with the energy used to operate the power plants.
            The most productive energy source currently is natural gas, also being the most efficient, but for the <b>96 million MWhs</b> that it produced in 2022,
            the power plants released the equivalent of <b style="color: red;">54 million MWhs</b> as heat and waste.
            For the <b>114 million MWhs</b> produced through fossil fuels and nuclear energy, there is a total waste energy of <b style="color: red">159 million MWhs</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the images below I have marked the lost electricity as it goes through the power grid.
            The first white image is the total electricity equivalent that is put in to the power plants.
            As it leaves the power plants, all of the <b style="color: blue;"><i>BLUE</i></b> colored area is lost to heat and waste.
            Already, <b style="color: red;">58%</b> of the energy is gone.
            In <b style="color: teal;"><i>TEAL</i></b> is the <b style="color: red;">5%</b> of the electricity that is lost in the power lines
            and power stations between power plants and the final user.
            In <b style="color: rgb(0,255,0);"><i>GREEN</i></b> is the amount of the energy that is lost in 
            the use of battery storage, which loses <b style="color: red;">10%</b> of the electricity that it interacts with. 
            Currently this is on the lower end, but battery storage is one of the most important parts of the 
            renewable based power grid, so it will grow with time.

            <p>
                This leaves the white area remaining at the end of the graph, accounting for <b>40%</b> of the
                input energy for non-renewable energies, and representing <b>43%</b> of the total usage of California in 2022.
                Below is the complete graphic of the fossil fuels and nuclear energy losses with the amount of energy
                used by all California households in one month colored <b style="color: red;"><i>RED</i></b>.
            </p>
        </div>

                Comparatively the following is the graphic for the renewable energy sources.
                In these sources the conversion from energy to electricity yields <b style="color: red;">no heat or waste</b>.
                Thus the energy loss is solely in the energy lost in transmission and battery storage.
                I have included the red box for Californian households average monthly describe the scale of the loss more explicitly.
                The size is larger than in the non-renewable images, since in 2022 the majority of the energy produced in 
                California was primarily in the non-renewable power plants.

                Currently, California is following the energy scoping plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045<sup>[#]</sup>.
                Support is necessary to help keep investment in the transition to renewable energy.
                Additionally new renewable sources like offshore wind are being introduced to portions
                of the coast of California creating more sources to support the power grid.
